## About

This repository contains the scripts used in the classification of the irrigation theme.

We recommend that you read the [Irrigation Appendix of the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD)](https://mapbiomas.org/download-dos-atbds), since important informations about the classification methodology can be found in there.  For the collection 5 of MapBiomas, we have two irrigation subclasses, both mapped from 2000 to 2019:

 - Center Pivot Irrigation System
 - Other Irrigation System (some study areas of the Brazilian semi-arid region)

## How to use

You can follow the instructions for each subclass in the links bellow.

 - [Center Pivot Irrigation System](./center-pivot-irrigation-systems) instructions;
 - [Other Irrigation System](./other-irrigation-systems) instructions.
