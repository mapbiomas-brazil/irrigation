## About

This repository contains the scripts used in the classification of the irrigation theme.

We recommend that you read the [Irrigation Appendix of the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD)](https://mapbiomas.org/download-dos-atbds), since important informations about the classification methodology can be found in there.  For the collection 7 of MapBiomas, we have three irrigation subclasses and a new product of pivot individualization (in **beta** version):

 - Center Pivot Irrigation System
 - Irrigated rice
 - Other Irrigation System (some study areas of the Brazilian semi-arid region)
 - Pivot Dynamics (**Beta**)

## How to use

You can follow the instructions for each subclass in the links bellow.

 - [Center Pivot Irrigation System](./center-pivot-irrigation-systems) instructions;
 - [Other Irrigation System](./other-irrigation-systems) instructions;
 - [Irrigated Rice](./irrigated-rice) instructions
 - [Pivot Dynamics](./pivot-dynamics) instructions
